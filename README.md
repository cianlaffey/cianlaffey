## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm Cian. I'm going into my third year of Computer Science w/ Business Studies student at Trinity College Dublin.

I first got into coding through courses like coder dojo, but really found my passion for it when making games in Unity! I love working on small projects with people. Prototyping a game idea and seeing if we work well together is a lot of fun for me, so please feel free to reach out.
